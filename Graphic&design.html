        <h1><u>Graphic & Designing</u></h1>
        <h3>Graphic design is the practice of composing and arranging the visual elements of a project. Designing the layout of a magazine, creating a poster for a theatre performance, and designing packaging for a product are all examples of graphic design.The objective of graphic design is to convey or enhance a message.
           Good graphic art streamlines communication. Just picture a spreadsheet with data analytics. A graphic designer might use different colors to highlight which metrics are rising and which are dropping, thus making it easier for the viewer to quickly understand what's going well and what needs to be adjusted.</h3>
        <p><strong><u>What is the main purpose of graphic design?</u></strong>
            The <strong>objective</strong> of graphic design is to convey or enhance a message.
            Good graphic art streamlines communication. Just picture a spreadsheet with data analytics. A graphic designer might use different colors to highlight which metrics are rising and which are dropping, thus making it easier for the viewer to quickly understand what's going well and what needs to be adjusted.
            Well executed graphic design can also elicit an emotional response from the viewer or even motivate them to take action. The “sign up” page on a website, for example, is typically designed to entice visitors to join an email list or start a free trial. Meanwhile, food packaging design aims to make the food inside seem more appealing to eat. 
            <br>
            Here are 9 of the most common types of graphic design with examples and links to help you get your creative juices flowing.
            <br>
            1. <strong><u>Brand design</u></strong>
            Brand design is the practice of setting guidelines and best practices for a company to use across all branded materials to ensure a consistent brand identity. Brand designers help communicate the personality, tone, and core messaging of a company, so this work involves a lot of strategy. 
            <br>
            Brand design work includes :-
            <br>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>designing logos and setting clear guidelines for how they're to be used.</li>
                <li>designing letterhead, icons, and various illustrations.</li>
                <li>selecting brand colors and setting clear guidelines for their usage.</li>
                <li>creating or selecting fonts and typography guidelines.</li>
                <li>creating templates that follow the brand guidelines and can be used by marketing, growth, and other teams.</li>
                <li>packaging design and graphics for product design.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Good brand designers have an understanding of marketing design, web design, logo design, and many other aspects of graphic design because the decisions they make will affect all subsequent design projects for that brand. If you've never worked with brand design guidelines before, check out Starbucks' creative expression website. This is a great example of various initiatives included in brand design and the type of guidelines a brand designer is expected to create to maintain a consistent visual identity.
            <br>
            2. <strong><u>Marketing design</u></strong>
            Marketing design is graphic design for marketing initiatives. Marketing designers may work on small projects, such as the layout of a promotional email, or large multi-faceted projects, such as designing the booth, hand-outs, and print materials for trade shows. 
            <br>
            Marketing designers may work on visual design for:
            <br>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>emails</li>
                <li>newsletters</li>
                <li>billboards and other signage</li>
                <li>posters</li>
                <li>print ads</li>
                <li>trade show booths</li>
                <li>physical mailers</li>
                <li>website assets</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            3. <strong><u>Web design</u></strong>
            Many graphic artists work on visual elements that will be used on a website. But it's important to note that web design and graphic design are different.
            <br>
            Web designers may work on projects including:
            <br>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Creating icons and buttons.</li>
                <li>Creating images, illustrations, and other graphics.</li>
                    <li>Designing web page layouts.</li>
                        <li>Creating various interactive design elements on a website.</li>
                            <li>Creating videos and gifs.</li>
                                <li>Helping ensure visual elements are optimized for all devices (desktop, mobile, etc.)</li>
                                    <li>Working with web development, UX, UI, and marketing design teams to improve overall experience for site visitors.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Of course, plenty of graphic designers are also web designers with knowledge of UX design principles and have created beautiful websites and mobile apps without the support of a large team. And thanks to no-code platforms like Webflow, designers can create stunning interactive websites without needing extensive knowledge of coding. 
            <br>
            4. <strong><u>Illustration design</u></strong>
            Illustrations are often included as part of web, marketing, and brand design — but they're also used in other ways. Some designers focus solely on offering illustrations and will work with larger design teams, contributing individual assets for various projects.
            <br>
            Illustrators may design visual assets for:
            <br>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>children's books</li>
                <li>t-shirts and other wearables</li>
                    <li>cards and stationary</li>
                        <li>websites</li>
                            <li>social media </li>
                                <li>video and interactive media</li>
                                    <li>marketing campaigns</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Illustration style and design process can vary drastically from designer to designer. Some artists work almost exclusively in digital formats using tools such Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or Procreate and others blend digital media with physical media, preferring to begin with a pencil and paper.
            <br>
            5. <strong><u>Type design</u></strong>
            Some graphic designers specialize in creating or selecting typography, typeface, or fonts.
            <br>
            Type design can include:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Creating custom lettering and numerals.</li>
                <li>Writing or digitally creating typography assets.</li>
                <li>Selecting fonts and creating typography guidelines for a brand.</li>
                <li>Humans rely heavily on words to communicate messaging, so type designers collaborate on a wide array of projects. Type designers may be hired to create logos or wedding invitations and they sometimes contribute to brand design by creating, selecting, or pairing fonts. It’s also common for type designers to create assets for web, marketing, product, or package design.</li>
            </ol>
