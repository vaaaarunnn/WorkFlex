        <h1><u>Digital Marketing</u></h1>
        <h3>Any marketing that uses electronic devices and can be used by marketing specialists to convey promotional messaging and measure its impact through your customer journey. In practice, digital marketing typically refers to marketing campaigns that appear on a computer, phone, tablet, or other device. It can take many forms, including online video, display ads, search engine marketing, paid social ads and social media posts. Digital marketing is often compared to “traditional marketing” such as magazine ads, billboards, and direct mail.</h3>
        <p><strong><u>Benefits of Digital Marketing</u>:--</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong><u>Reach a large demographic</u></strong>
            Digital marketing allows you to reach a wider customer base with less effort. When you post an ad online, it can reach anyone, regardless of their location. You can connect with customers on the other side of the world, in multiple time zones, as seamlessly as though you were taking out an ad in the local newspaper. You can expand your market reach and grow your business in ways that would have seemed impossible before.
            <br>
            <strong><u>Cost efficiency</u></strong>
            Traditional marketing channels like TV, radio, and print media typically have higher costs than digital channels. Posting on social media and creating blogs doesn’t have a cost beyond the time you spend producing the content. You can create a slick, professional website for a relatively low cost by using one of the many templated systems or paying more for a bespoke creation. You can create social media accounts for free, and partner with an email service provider (ESP) for a competitive price.Types of digital marketing
            Digital marketing is so beneficial because of its flexibility. It comes in various forms, which gives businesses more opportunities than ever before to connect with their target audiences. Let’s look at the 12 key types of digital marketing.<br>
            
            <strong><u>Content marketing</u></strong>
            Content marketing is a type of digital marketing that aims to educate and share value to readers instead of promoting a product or service. It isn’t outwardly promotional in nature, but establishes your business as a thought leader and a trustworthy source of information.
            <br>
            <br>
            Like digital marketing, <strong>content marketing</strong> also comes in many forms, including:
            <br>
            <ol type="i">
            <li>Blog posts<br></li>
            <li>Ebooks<br></li>
            <li>Newsletters<br></li>
            <li>Guides <br></li>
            <li>Infographics<br></li>
            <li>Audio content, like podcasts<br></li>
            <li>Video content, like YouTube Shorts<br></li>
            </ol>
            Content marketing is not only affordable, but it’s also effective. In 2022, 80% of marketers thought their content marketing strategy was very successful. It’s no wonder why the content marketing industry is projected to be worth $107 billion by 2026.

            <strong><u>Search engine optimization (SEO)</u></strong>
            SEO is the process of optimizing the content, technical setup, and reach of your website so your pages appear at the top of a search engine result page for a specific set of keyword terms. With SEO, businesses analyze their website’s performance, score it against competitors, and create a data-backed strategy to improve their rankings over time.
            <br>
            In digital marketing, the <strong>Goal</strong> is to get your content to the top of the search engine results page (SERP). This is important because 67.6% of organic traffic clicks come from the first five results on the SERP. Most businesses boost their rankings on the SERPs by:
            <br>
            <ol type="i"> 
            <li>Creating quality content.<br></li>
            <li>Fostering user engagement.<br></li>
            <li>Ensuring marketing material is mobile-friendly.<br></li>
            </ol>
            Businesses also have to consider on-page and off-page SEO, as well as technical SEO. On-page SEO focuses on optimizing aspects of your website that users engage with. This facet of SEO leans heavily into keyword research. With the right list of target keywords, you can optimize your web copy to answer your audience’s most important questions.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Off-page SEO, on the other hand, is the practice of optimizing activity outside of your website that could affect your rankings. With off-page SEO, you look at all the ways you can garner external attention to your website. This generally focuses on gathering quality backlinks to your site, which can affect your rankings in the long term.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, technical SEO looks at the back end of your website and the coding of each page. Search engines crawl the back end of your site code to determine SERP rankings, so you’ll need programming knowledge to optimize this. With technical SEO, you’ll look at page speed, image compression, and metadata to ensure you’re set up for SERP success.
            <br>
            <strong><u>Search engine marketing (SEM)</u></strong> 
            Not to be confused with SEO, SEM revolves around paid ads that display in the SERPs. Paid search typically refers to the sponsored result on the top or side of a SERP. These ads appear when users enter a certain search term. As the advertiser, you pay every time someone clicks on your ad. The two most popular SEM platforms are Google Ads and Bing Ads.
            SEM works because 68% of online experiences start with organic and paid searches. By promoting your brand at the source of most online experiences, you can attract more interested leads to your site.<br>
